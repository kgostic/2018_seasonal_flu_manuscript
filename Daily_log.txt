Manuscript is mostly drafted, except citations. Goal is to send to senior authors by end of day. 
AM: When I applied to use INSIGHT data, I proposed an analysis based on GLMMs (essentially fancy logistic regression). I ended up doing linear, likelihood-based model fitting instead, because I was concerned that the data violated some of the assumptions of GLMM analysis, and I thought a different method might yield better power. 

In case the INSIGHT committee member asks me to do GLMMs, I wanted to make sure the multinomial analysis would yield the same results if I calculated probabilities of protection slightly differently. Currently, I'm calculating average probs of protection per birth year x country-season. To do GLMMs, I need to calculate a prob for every individual in the data, and then (for multinomial), take the average across all valid individuals in a given country-season and age. 

I wrote code to do the individual-level analysis this AM, in the IMPORT INSIGHT file. It yields the same model comparison results, with marginally different AIC values. I"m sticking with the original method for now, as the results are essentially the same and the methods/outputs are already written up. But I can easily switch methods if I need to add GLMMs later.

Updated manuscript and emailed to Jamie and Mike.
